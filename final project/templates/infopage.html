    <text>🔥Global Temperature Rise & Climate Trends
Since the Industrial Revolution, global annual temperature has risen by just over 1°C (2°F).
From 1850 to 1980, temperatures rose by 0.07°C per decade.
Since 1981, the rate has more than doubled to 0.2°C per decade.
The 10 warmest years on record have all occurred recently.
Rising temperatures increase the risk of climate tipping points (e.g., glacier melt, permafrost thaw).</text>

<text>🌍Paris Agreement & Global Goal
The Paris Agreement (2015) aims to limit warming to 1.5°C to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Meeting this target helps reduce risks of extreme events like droughts, wildfires, floods, and storms.</text>

<text>☁️ Causes of Global Warming
Driven by increased greenhouse gases like CO₂, which trap heat in the atmosphere.
Human activity—especially burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)—is the primary driver of current warming.
Natural climate cycles exist, but current warming is human-induced.</text>

<text>🌧️ Link to Extreme Weather
A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture → more intense rainfall and flooding.
Warmer temperatures also cause more evaporation → stronger droughts and heatwaves.
NASA research (2023) confirmed the “wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier” trend globally.
Example: Long pluvial in central Africa raised Lake Victoria by over 3 feet.
Drought in Brazil (2015–2016) led to water shortages and rationing.</text>

<text>🌊 Ocean Warming & Storms
Warmer oceans fuel stronger tropical storms and hurricanes.
storms are more intense and damaging, especially in coastal areas.
Climate-related disasters are increasing in frequency and cost worldwide.</text>

<text>💥 Wider Impacts of Global Warming
Affects health, economy, agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods.
Health risks: heat stress, allergies, asthma, spread of diseases via insects.
People are being displaced from uninhabitable environments.
Melting ice is altering ecosystems from mountains to coasts.</text>

<text>⚖️ Inequitable Impact
Climate change affects everyone, but not equally.
Indigenous Peoples, marginalized groups, and people of color are hit hardest.
Structural inequalities increase vulnerability to climate impacts, despite minimal contributions to the problem.</text>

<text>🙌 What Individuals Can Do
Individual actions matter in tackling global warming.
Ways to reduce your carbon footprint:
Conserve energy daily.
Choose energy-efficient appliances (e.g., Energy Star).
Use public transportation or carpool.
Opt for vehicles with high fuel efficiency or electric vehicles (EVs).
Support climate-friendly policies and push for a transition to clean energy.
Join or support movements focused on climate justice and community resilience.</text>
